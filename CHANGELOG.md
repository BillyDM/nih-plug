# nice-plug 0.4.1

## Changed
* `nice-plug-core`, `nice-plug`, bumped to version `0.4.1`
* Deprecated functions and constants that use "MIDI note" terminology in favor of "MIDI key" for consistency

## Added
* Added `MIDDLE_C` constant and `number_or_middle_c()` method to `Key` struct
* Added missing documentation

# nice-plug 0.4.0

## Breaking Changes
* `nice-plug-core`, `nice-plug`, and `nice-plug-iced` bumped to version `0.4`
* `nice-plug-egui` bumped to version `0.5`
* The `Editor` trait and the `ResizeHint` struct now use the new `NativeSize` type instead of `PhysicalSize`
* `track_info_updated()` method has moved from the `Plugin` trait to the `Editor` trait
* Minimum Rust version bumped to `1.88` (#55)
* `ProcessContext::send_event()` method has been renamed to `try_send_event()`, and is now fallible
* The `note` fields in `NoteEvent` have been renamed to `key` to be more consistent with MIDI terminology
* `NoteEvent` voice IDs, channel numbers, and key numbers all now support wildcard variants
* `NoteEvent::as_midi()` now takes a reference to `self`
* `SysExMessage::to_buffer()` was renamed to `as_buffer()`, and now takes a reference to `self`

## Added
* Added ASIO standalone backend (by Jakub Turowski in #79)
* Added `FloatRange::gain_range()` method (by Jeremy Stafford in #81)
* Added `GuiContext::request_restart()` to allow plugin GUIs to request a restart of the plugin
* Added `Plugin::INPUT_EVENT_CAPACITY` constant to allow users to adjust the allocated capacity for input events

the plugin to sleep (currently only used in CLAP plugins)
* Added `track_info_changed()` method to `NiceGuiApp` trait
* Added `new_track_info()` method to `IcedNiceContext`

## Changed
* Many panics triggered by the host misbehaving or by malformed state have been replaced with debug log messages

## Optimized
* Added `ParamInfo` struct to parameters to reduce memory footprint in hot audio path (by Jakub Turowski in #80)
* Optimized event sorting logic (for the most common case) in the VST3 wrapper and made it realtime safe

## Fixed
* Made plugin locking logic more robust and guaranteed to be realtime-safe
* Added protections when loading malformed state (#85)
* Plugins no longer panic when the host sends a large number of events at once (#87)
* In-place processing is now only enabled when the number of main input and output channels match (#84)
* Non-finite parameter values from the host are now filtered out to prevent state corruption (#86)
* Fixed sample-accurate block splitting logic in clap wrapper (#91)
* Fixed a regression where parameters wouldn't be rescanned after a state change
* Fixed a rounding issue in `v2s_f32_hz_then_khz()`
* Added a flag to prevent filling up VST3 fd socket
* Fixed a minor atomic ordering issue with voice info in clap wrapper

Also thanks to maxmcorp and davfre for finding various issues!

# nice-plug 0.3.0

## Breaking Changes
* All crates updated to use baseview version `0.3.1`
* `nice-plug-core`, `nice-plug`, and `nice-plug-iced` bumped to version `0.3`
* `nice-plug-egui` bumped to version `0.4`
* `nice-plug-egui` updated to use `egui` version `0.36`
* A new `editor` cargo feature was added to `nice-plug` and `nice-plug-core`. Disabling this will disable all GUI-related
code entirely, saving some processing overhead and reducing binary size.
* `Plugin::initialize()` and `InitContext` renamed to `Plugin::activate()` and `ActivateContext`
* A new `Editor` type was added to the `Plugin` trait. Plugins without an editor can set this to `()`.
* `Plugin::editor()` now returns `Option<Self::Editor>` instead of `Option<Box<dyn Editor>>`
* The `Editor` trait was completely overhauled to support better handling of window resizing and scaling. See
[editor.rs](https://codeberg.org/RustAudio/nice-plug/src/commit/1f496ddd098b5ce050f4617322ec4c8718b94a62/crates/nice-plug-core/src/editor.rs)
for more details.
* Added `resize_hint` field to `EguiNiceSettings`
* The build and update closures in `create_egui_editor` were replaced with a new `NiceEguiApp` trait
* `EguiState` was renamed to `EguiEditorState`
* Renamed `EditorState` in `nice-plug-iced` to `PersistentState`
* Renamed `EditorSettings` in `nice-plug-iced` to `IcedNiceSettings` and added `resize_hint` field
* `nice-plug-egui` no longer automatically repaints every frame. Use the new `RepaintNotifier` to notify the GUI when it
should repaint.

## Added
* Better integration for window resizing and scaling in CLAP, VST3, and standalone targets

## Changed
* Window size is no longer saved/loaded with the plugin's preset state

# nice-plug 0.2.3

## Fixed
* Actually invoke logging setup in CLAP and VST3 targets ([#66](https://codeberg.org/RustAudio/nice-plug/pulls/66))

# nice-plug 0.2.2

## Fixed
* Fixed compiling on Windows

## Changed
* There is no longer a compiler error when using the `assert_process_allocs` feature on the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu target.

# nice-plug 0.2.0

## Breaking Changes
* all crates updated to use baseview version `0.2`
* `nice-plug-core` and `nice-plug` bumped to version 0.2
* `nice-log` bumped to version 0.3
* `nice-plug-egui` bumped to version 0.4
* `nice-plug-iced` bumped to version 0.2
* `Editor::size()` now returns the `Size` type from the `dpi` crate
* `Editor::set_size()` now uses `PhysicalSize<u32>` from the `dpi` crate
* `ParentWindowHandle` enum has been reworked to be more in-line with `raw-window-handle` 0.6
* `create_egui_editor` has been updated for the new version of `egui-baseview`
* `EguiState` in `nice-plug-egui` has been overhauled (window resizing can now be done with the standard `ui.send_viewport_command()` method in egui.)
* The `Queue` struct in `nice-plug-egui` was renamed to `ExtraOutputCommands`
* Some methods removed in `ExtraOutputCommands` in favor of `ui.send_viewport_command()`.
* reworked methods in `NiceGuiContext` from `nice-plug-iced`
* added `window_title` field to `EditorSettings` in `nice-plug-iced`
* `WrapperConfig::dpi_scale` in the standalone target now uses `f64` instead of `f32`
* `nice_log` was overhauled to support the `tracing` crate

## Added
* `Editor::set_scale_factor()` (called when the host requests to set the scaling factor)
* `Plugin::setup_logger()` (can be used to set up logging filters, called when the program first initializes)
* Added a new `tracing-subscriber` feature to `nice-plug` that when enabled, automatically sets up a default logger using `tracing- subscriber`.

## Changed
* `Editor::spawn()` now returns `Box<dyn Any>` instead of `Box<dyn Any + Send>`
* nice-plug now uses `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` instead of `log`

# nice-plug 0.1.9

* Fixed "unsafe" compiler warning when using the `nice_export_vst3!` macro.

# nice-plug 0.1.8

# nice-plug 0.1.3

nice-plug has been published to crates.io! 🎉

(versions 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.1.2 are identical to 0.1.3, the only changes were fixing
issues with the readme)
